/* Dart Maps :- The Map is an object that is used to represents a set of values as key-value pairs.
* In Map, both keys and values can be of any type of object.
* In Map, each key can only occurs once, but the same value can be used multiple times.
* The Map can be defined by using curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]).
