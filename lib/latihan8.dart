/* In Dart, list data type is used to represent a collection of objects.
* A List is an ordered group of objects.
* The List data type in Dart is synonymous to the concept of an array in other programming languages.
* An array is used to hold multiple values in single variable. In Dart, arrays are List objects, so most people just call them lists.
* Dart list literals look like JavaScript array literals.
* A list variable is defined by having values separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]).
